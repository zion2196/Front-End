        <h2> Investment Products   
        </h2>

            <p>Investment products are available for individual and institutional investors, and are purchased in an attempt to generate a profit. Some investment products, such as certain types of bonds, provide a fixed interest payment in addition to a return of the initial investment at the time of maturity. Other types of investment products, such as stocks, entail greater risk and while earnings (and profits) are anticipated, they are not guaranteed. An investor who diversifies will have a variety of investment products in his or her portfolio to manage risk.

        <h2>Portfolio Management
        </h2>

            <p>A portfolio strategy that involves setting target allocations for various asset classes, and periodically rebalancing the portfolio back to the original allocations when they deviate significantly from the initial settings due to differing returns from various assets. In strategic asset allocation, the target allocations depend on a number of factors – such as the investor’s risk tolerance, time horizon and investment objectives – and may change over time as these parameters change. Strategic asset allocation is compatible with a “buy and hold” strategy, as opposed to tactical asset allocation which is more suited to an active trading approach. Strategic and tactical asset allocation are based on modern portfolio theory, which emphasizes diversification in order to reduce risk and improve portfolio returns.
